# Admin side user story



#### User Management Interface.

As an employee I will need to see the checked in patients in a chronologically descending order.
(would like this to be an interactive bubble that expands to display data collected from patient check-in.)



**Acceptance criteria**

- Screen displays patient check-in time and First initial and last name.
  (This should be scraped from information gathered by the 'initial')'demographics' and Visit details screen)
- Screen displays patient check-ins in a cascade order from first come first served order
- Screen shows currently open interactions, (this is to prevent duplicate check-ins)


**Definition of done**

- Pop-up or expand window that shows collection of patient check-in information
that includes all pertinent data gathered on the patient check-in terminal.

#### Encounter Management Interface ####

As a employee I should be able to manipulate data that may have been entered incorrectly
or to assist a blind or otherwise disabled person.

**Acceptance criteria**

- Interacting with a field in the patient allows modification of previously entered data.
- Presented with a save and confirm button upon making changes to patient data.
- Display a next open check-in button to advance work flow.
